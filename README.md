# Warcraft III reimplementation

A fresh C++ implementation, developed by measuring real Warcraft III and comparing
small behaviors. Raylib will provide the first renderer; compatibility work will
also run headlessly.

Repository: [galitianu/warcraft-re](https://github.com/galitianu/warcraft-re) (private).

**Target:** Warcraft III **1.29.2 (9321), x86 32-bit**
(`wc3-1.29.2-9321-x86`), running in the user's working Windows 11 Pro ARM64 VM.

**First release, v0.0.1:** one Footman moves, and its movement can be compared
numerically with the same experiment in WC3. The comparison can initially fail;
having trustworthy observations comes first.

Start with:

- [Implementation plan](Warcraft-III-Reimplementation-Plan.md): decisions, Phase 0–8
  sequence, and acceptance gates. The appendix contains older suggestions and
  example results, not completed work.
- [Progress](PROGRESS.md): current state and the next concrete action.
- [Agent guidance](AGENTS.md): scope, evidence, Windows access, and working rules.
- [Salvage assessment](docs/salvage.md): what the previous work actually contains
  and which pieces may help this plan.

This repository will hold the engine, experiments, oracle tooling, and reference
fixtures together. Today it contains the plan and startup documentation. Engine
bootstrap follows the first recoverable WC3 experiment; no gameplay compatibility
has been demonstrated yet.

Use GitHub issues for concrete work and `PROGRESS.md` for the concise status. Keep
results linked to their experiments and commits. There is no separate agent harness
or task database to maintain here.

Windows access is available through `rdpipe`; run `rdpipe guide` before using it.
The next task is to record the game/VM identity, author a tiny automatic movement
experiment, recover its text output, and repeat the capture.
